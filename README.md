# Bioelectrician
I am currently working towards a BS in Physics at the University of California in Santa Cruz. I am developing my expertise in synthetic biology. Specifically, I am interested in the emerging ability to control developmental outcomes of animals via modulating the activity of cellular ion translocators.
