# Translative Synthetic Biology
I am synthetic biologist intending to bring emerging technologies to market. I specialize in computational models of information flow in living tissue. This repository documents my project-based journey in developing such an expertise. I welcome inquiries for work and collaboration.  
I am currently a Physics undergraduate at the University of California in Santa Cruz.
