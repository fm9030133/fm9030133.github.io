# ["Endogenous Bioelectric Signaling Networks: Exploiting Voltage Gradients for Control of Growth and Form (2017)"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071114-040647)
*Unless otherwise stated, all quotes and discussions on this page reference the above linked publication.*  
My goal(s) in this discussion are to:
- Distill the publication into visually communicative engineering 'cheat sheet/handbook' that can be referenced 'at a glance'. For my own understanding and as a concise refernce to facilitate further investigation.

Compelling points:  
- "strategies recently developed to infer semantic content and information processing from ionic activity in the brain might provide important clues to cracking the bioelectric code"
- "embryos of many species are not predetermined mosaics, but exhibit astonishing capabilities of self-repair, dynamic rescaling, reconfiguration, and functional plasticity"
- "cancer may be a kind of disease of geometry"
- "Next-generation bioengineering must move beyond the direct assembly of cell types toward the control of the endogenous error-correcting morphogenetic networks and the programming of shape by specifying organs and their topological relationships"
- "Next-generation bioengineering must move beyond the direct assembly of cell types toward the control of the endogenous error-correcting morphogenetic networks and the programming of shape by specifying organs and their topological relationships"
- Two open research programs outlined to overcome bottlenecks:
    1. Theoretical paradigm for understanding complex pattern regulation
    2. Quantitative models enabling rational modification of shape.
- Three "distinct and orthogonal [control] layers of the morphogenetic field.":
    1. Chemical gradients
    2. Physical forces
    3. Bioelectric signaling
- "implicated steady ion currents in embryogenesis and wound healing"
- "By tracking developmental currents and applying
physiological-strength electric fields, investigators have shown that transepithelial electric fields
regulate cell migration, orientation, and nerve growth."
- "Bioelectric circuits consist of several main components:"
    1. "**ion channel proteins**, which passively segregate specific positive and negative charges across the membrane"
    2. "**ion pumps**, which use energy to transport ions against concentration gradients"
