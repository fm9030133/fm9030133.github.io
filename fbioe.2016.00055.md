# ["Exploring Instructive Physiological Signaling with the Bioelectric Tissue Simulation Engine (2016)"](http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fbioe.2016.00055)
*Unless otherwise stated, all quotes and discussions on this page reference the above linked publication.*  
My goal(s) in this discussion are to:
- Improve my understanding of BETSE and bioelectric control in general.
----------
- Bioelectric cell properties are powerful targets for modulating:
    - Stem cell function
    - Regeneratie response
    - Developemental patterning
    - Tumor reprograming

- Properties such as distributions of:
    - Resting potentials
    - Ion flows
    - Electric fields
