# ["Exploring Instructive Physiological Signaling with the Bioelectric Tissue Simulation Engine (2016)"](http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fbioe.2016.00055)
*Unless otherwise stated, all quotes and discussions on this page reference the above linked publication.*  
My goal(s) in this discussion are to:
- Improve my understanding of BETSE and bioelectric control in general.
----------
- Bioelectric cell properties are powerful targets for modulating:
    - Stem cell function
    - Regeneratie response
    - Developemental patterning
    - Tumor reprograming

- Properties such as distributions of:
    - Resting potentials
    - Ion flows
    - Electric fields

- "Explaining and learning to control large-scale pattern is a central unsolved problem"
- "dynamics of signals orchestrating large-scale order *in vivo*"
- "ednogenous bioelectric gradients across tissues can be a very early pre-pattern for susequent transcriptional and morphogenetic events."
- "imperative to understand not only how ion channel and pump activity controls single-cell electrical properties but also how electrical gradients self-organize, propagate, and evolve in multicellular networks."

- "ephaptic coupling created by local field potentials"
- "Even briefly altering the bioelectric connectivity of a cellular network enable rewriting of an organism's target morphology."
- "trans-epithelial potential (TEP)... forms at the outer boundary of an organ or organism."
- "The TEP is created when multicellular structures develop impermeable tight junctions (TJ) between cells at the exterior boundary"
- "Understanding plasma membrane voltage gradients and transepithelial potentials, and their spatiotemporal transitions *in vivo* is a key enabling step"
- "biorealistic perspective of ion concentrations and movements, rather than an equivalent electric circuit model"
- "realistic modeling system for bioelectricity will enable":
    1. formulation of models of specific patterning events based on realistic physiological and channel expression data
    2. design of predicted intervention strategies for inducing desired changes in electrical state and downstream patterning outcomes
    3. investigation of the broader capabilities of non-neural bioelectrical networks for use in synthetic biology and unconventional computation architectures
- "BETSE integrate a diverse range of mechanisms...":
